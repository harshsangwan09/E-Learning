                        E-learning comprises all forms of electronically supported learning and 
                        teaching. The information and communication systems, whether networked learning 
                        or not, serve as specific media to implement the learning process.[1] The term 
                        will still most likely be utilized to reference out-of-classroom and 
                        in-classroom educational experiences via technology, even as advances continue 
                        in regard to devices and curriculum. E-learning is essentially the computer and 
                        network-enabled transfer of skills and knowledge. E-learning applications and 
                        processes include Web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual education 
                        opportunities and digital collaboration. Content is delivered via the Internet, 
                        intranet/extranet, audio or video tape, satellite TV, and CD-ROM. It can be 
                        self-paced or instructor-led and includes media in the form of text, image, 
                        animation, streaming video and audio. Abbreviations like CBT (Computer-Based 
                        Training), IBT (Internet-Based Training) or WBT (Web-Based Training) have been 
                        used as synonyms to e-learning. Today one can still find these terms being used, 
                        along with variations of e-learning such as elearning, Elearning, and eLearning. 
                        The terms will be utilized throughout this article to indicate their validity 
                        under the broader terminology of E-learning.</td>
