                    JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the internet, and works in 
                    all major browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and 
                    Safari.</p>

                    What You Should Already Know</h2>
                <p>
                    Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What is JavaScript?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is a scripting language</li>
                    <li>A scripting language is a lightweight programming language</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML pages</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without 
                        preliminary compilation)</li>
                    <li>Everyone can use JavaScript without purchasing a license</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Are Java and JavaScript the same?</h2>
                <p>
                    NO!</p>
                <p>
                    Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages in both concept and 
                    design!</p>
                <p>
                    Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex 
                    programming language - in the same category as C and C++.</p>
                <h2>
                    What Can JavaScript do?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - </b>HTML authors are 
                        normally not programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very 
                        simple syntax! Almost anyone can put small &quot;snippets&quot; of code into their HTML 
                        pages</li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript can react to events - </b>A JavaScript can be set to execute when 
                        something happens, like when a page has finished loading or when a user clicks 
                        on an HTML element</li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript can read and write HTML elements - </b>A JavaScript can read and 
                        change the content of an HTML element</li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript can be used to validate data - </b>A JavaScript can be used to 
                        validate form data before it is submitted to a server. This saves the server 
                        from extra processing</li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript can be used to detect the visitor&#39;s browser</b> - A JavaScript can 
                        be used to detect the visitor&#39;s browser, and - depending on the browser - load 
                        another page specifically designed for that browser</li>
                    <li><b>JavaScript can be used to create cookies</b> - A JavaScript can be used to 
                        store and retrieve information on the visitor&#39;s computer</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    JavaScript = ECMAScript</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript language standard. ECMA-262 is 
                    the official JavaScript standard.</p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape (with Navigator 2.0), and 
                    has appeared in all browsers since 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    The official standardization was adopted by the <a target="_blank">ECMA 
                    organization</a> (an industry standardization association) in 1997.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    The ECMA standard (called ECMAScript-262) was approved as an international ISO 
                                                    (ISO/IEC 16262) standard in 1998.</p>
                <p>
                    The development is still in progress.</p>
